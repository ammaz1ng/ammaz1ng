# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to ammaz1ng ðŸ‘‹

### Introduction
Hello, welcome to ammaz1ng! This will be a guide to help you bypass your chromebook restrictions.
Some things you will be able to do with this guide:
- Bypass blocked sites
- Watch movies
- Play games

### Getting started
Before we get started, make sure you are able to visit some sort of hosting website. If your administrator blocks web hosting services, you are pretty much out of luck. Also, some web hosting services block proxies, so if you come across this error, just find a new host or proxy.

Things you will need:
- Hosting service
  - Railway, Cyclic, or Vercel is recommended
- Proxy service
  - Shuttle or HyperTabs is recommended
- Chromebook

### Shuttle compatibility
Currently, Shuttle is not supported by Railway. It's recommended to use Cyclic to host Shuttle. If Cyclic is blocked (either the hosting site or the subdomain), then you might want to use another hosting service. 

### HyperTabs compatibility
HyperTabs is supported by Railway (as of right now).

### Shuttle setup
Shuttle on Cyclic:
- Forking Shuttle
  - Create a GitHub account if you haven't already
  - Go to [Shuttle's official repository](https://github.com/shuttlenetwork/shuttle)
  - Click the "Fork" button
  - Click the "Create fork" button
- Sign up or login
  - Go to https://www.cyclic.sh/
  - Click sign up (or log in if you have an account)
  - Connect your GitHub account that you created earlier
- Deploy your app
  - Under "Deploy Your First App", click "Link Your Own"
  - Under "Connect your repo", select the repository that you forked earlier
  - Click the "Connect Cyclic" button
  - Scroll down and click the "Approve & Install" button

  - Click the link to be redirected to Shuttle
